# Movie Review

This is a sample project. Redux is one of the hard concepts to grab on, hence, I have created this little project that will help me to learn redux with deep understanding.

Along with the actual react learning process, my goal with this app is to get in on good ui designing techniques.

## Data about movies

Most of the data about the movies like descriptions, reviews, posters is grabbed from a couple of sources including and not exclusive to Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, YTS. The data is supposed to simulate the actual database, and hence is restructured in custom format and provided under the file `_DATA.js`.

## Installation

In order to run the app, first clone this repository or download the zip files. Once done, open terminal in the given directory. and run the following lines:

```
npm install           # Use yarn install if on yarn
npm start             # Use yarn start if on yarn
```

## Development
This is just a project I built to make my foundation of React and Redux solid. In case you want to submit a PR, you are welcome to do so. Just be sure to follow the guidelines of eslint.
